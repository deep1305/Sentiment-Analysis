In its annual review, the center expressed concerns about the emergence of state-aligned actors targeting critical national infrastructure, including power, water, and internet networks. It also highlighted the rise of a new class of cyber adversaries sympathetic to Russia\\'s actions in Ukraine and ideologically motivated.\\n\\nThe report emphasized the enduring and significant threat posed by states and state-aligned groups, citing Russian-language criminals using ransomware attacks against British firms and China-affiliated cyber actors pursuing strategic objectives that threaten the security and stability of UK interests. The center echoed warnings from other intelligence agencies, characterizing China\\'s ascent as a tech superpower as an \"epoch-defining challenge for UK security,\" cautioning against the risk of China becoming the predominant power in cyberspace.\\n\\nAdditionally, the report highlighted the evolving threat posed by artificial intelligence to elections, particularly the use of deepfake videos and hyper-realistic bots for spreading disinformation during campaigns. Despite the traditional method of voting in the UK with pencil and paper, the center expressed concerns about the potential impact of advanced AI technologies on the electoral process, especially in the context of the upcoming national election scheduled before January 2025.#deepfake #ai #uselection #cybersecurity #news #thealertx',\n",

It typically consists of several stages, starting from awareness and moving through consideration and decision-making.\\n\\n*Awareness: This is where potential buyers become aware of a particular car brand or model. It could be through advertisements, social media, or other marketing channels.\\n\\n*Interest/Consideration: At this stage, people are showing interest in the cars they've become aware of. They might be researching, comparing different models, reading reviews, and considering their options.\\n\\n*Desire: After considering various options, potential buyers develop a desire for a specific car. This could be driven by specific features, performance, or other factors that align with their needs and preferences.\\n\\n*Action/Purchase: The final stage is where the potential buyer takes action and makes a purchase. This could happen at a dealership or online, depending on the buying process.\\n\\nPicture this: Imagine starting your car journey in a world of choices, where curiosity turns into discovery. Move through the stages of thinking about it, where preferences become desires. As things progress, reach the point of deciding, where the journey becomes owning your dream car.\\n\\n#instagram #elonmusk #automarketing #tiktokads #ecommerce #uselection #shopify #blackownedbusiness #donaldtrump #dropshipping #digitalmarketing #trending #topic @kxngjess @ac_hampton @missmargariita @learnwithchelsea @willchangelives @dropship #entrepreneur #ecom #onlinebusiness #onlinestore #shopifydropshipping #sidehustle #investment #trendingtopics\",\n",

       " 'The following excerpt can be read in-full at my Link in Bio:\\nOhioans here in the U.S. are voting on whether we will codify the right to an abortion with polls closing Tuesday evening, November 7. The vote comes in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in the summer of 2022 which essentially removed federal protections on reproductive rights leaving the decision to each state’s laws to dictate all parameters of access to abortion care.\\n•\\nGrowing up in a conservative evangelical home and committing myself to a life of ministry while still in primary school, pro-life was the unquestioned position throughout my adolescence. To give proper treatment to the story, I dressed up as Al Gore for Halloween in fifth grade to make fun of his environmental policies and listened to right wing radio shows during 7th grade Study Hall.\\n•\\nI was religiously programmed as a child of the 90s with much of the same material as used by the far right today, but we just called it “youth group” back then. After barely graduating high school, I moved to the West Side of Chicago where I was immersed in new perspectives which opened my eyes to a pluralistic society and in turn allowed me to hold a spiritual belief that was different from my political belief for the first time. \\n•\\nYears later, I am now staunchly pro-choice and overtly anti-institutionalist. I no longer feel any conflict in voting “yes” for bodily autonomy as I no longer believe in the god of my formative years. I do, however, sympathize with those who will feel conflicted while at the poll — be it in Ohio, the U.S., or in any community on this blue marble we all call home. They believe there is an eternal god who creates each individual human in the womb when the most expeditious swimmer reaches the egg. If one does not change their belief on divine creation in the womb, they will not change their view that abortion is equivalent to homicide…\\n\\n<Link in bio to read the rest>',\n",

Mr. Daines is considering an endorsement for Ms. Lake, which may convince moderate donors to give the conservative firebrand a second look. A person close to Ms. Lake confirmed that she had filed paperwork to open her Senate campaign. She is scheduled to hold her first rally as a candidate next week.\\n\\nMs. Lake lost the governor’s race to Katie Hobbs by about 17,000 votes, a little over half a percentage point. She was one of many Republicans, including several in Arizona, who lost close contests last year after running on Mr. Trump’s lie that the 2020 election had been stolen. While most of those Republicans conceded their own losses, Ms. Lake followed Mr. Trump’s lead and continued to insist that she had won even after her legal challenges were rejected.\\nFull story https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/us/politics/kari-lake-senate-arizona.html 🟪#karilake #kyrstensinema #lmao #politicalart #politicalcartoon #politicalcartoons #presidential #purpleroompolitics #redwave #republican #republicans #ridinwithbiden #tgif #trump2024 #trumpsupporters #tsrpolitics #twitter #uselection #weekendwarrior #wethepeople',\n",

The public risks entering an election with critical information withheld. He may well refuse to leave office peacefully in 2008 when his term expires. With investigations and indictments looming once he's a private citizen again, Trump could invoke emergency powers or the military to extend his presidency indefinitely. He's already convinced supporters that prosecutions are political hits by a corrupt Biden administration.\\n\\nThe presidency shields Trump from accountability. But by announcing his 2024 bid so early, ironically he triggered the appointment of a special counsel overseeing criminal probes that otherwise may have stalled. Trump's tactic backfired, kickstarting the legal reckoning he hoped to avoid.\\n\\nStill, if Trump regains the White House, he can halt investigations, pardon himself, and prosecute opponents. He's suggested as much already. Trump erodes faith in impartial justice and peaceful transition of power.

       " 'During a Heal-the-Divide PAC event, Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. introduced a transformative economic plan focused on bitcoin. His proposal envisions a stable monetary foundation by gradually integrating bitcoin and precious metals into the US dollar, while eliminating capital gains tax on bitcoin earnings. Kennedy aims to ease the US debt burden by backing it with hard assets like gold, silver, platinum, and bitcoin. This groundbreaking plan has the potential to strengthen the dollar, control inflation, and usher in prosperity. Additionally, Kennedy believes that the exemption of BTC from capital gains tax would foster innovation, investments, privacy protection, and domestic business growth.\\n\\nSource: Coinedition\\n\\nLike, follow and comment for more updated Crypto and Blockchain news. \\n\\n#cryptostreettv #cryptocurrency #cryptocurrencies #cryptoworld #cryptonews #crypto #uselection #cryptotrading #nfts #nft #trading #blockchaintechnology',\n",

In last year’s midterms, Democratic candidates won 57% of Hispanic voters, a lower percentage than the 66% that backed the party in the 2018 midterms. Similarly, in 2020 Donald Trump did 8 percentage points better with Hispanic voters than he did in 2016, winning nearly 40% of the group’s voters nationally.\\n\\nRead the full Post on the UnHerd website, link in the bio.',\n",

He advocated for middle-class tax cuts, expanded access to healthcare, and continued social programs.\\n\\nBob Dole presented himself as an experienced and seasoned leader, promising tax cuts and a balanced budget. He criticized Clinton's handling of the economy and sought to appeal to conservative voters with his stance on social issues.\\n\\nUltimately, Bill Clinton emerged victorious, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College.

       " \"One of the best investigative journalists of the 2000s, Greg Palast is known for his work exposing corporate and political corruption, environmental destruction and third-world exploitation by global capitalism. I first came across him when he appeared on US talk radio around 2002 just after the released of his debut book 'The Best Democracy Money Can Buy'.\\n\\nPalast gained international attention when he uncovered voter suppression and fraud during the 2000 U.S. presidential election. In Florida, where the race between George W. Bush and Al Gore was incredibly close, Palast found evidence that thousands of eligible voters, mainly African-Americans, were purged from the voting rolls due to a faulty system of identification checks that incorrectly matched their names with those of convicted felons (some even had conviction dates in the future). \\n\\nThis flawed and biased system of voter identification was implemented under the administration of Governor Jeb Bush, George W. Bush's brother, which disproportionately affected minority voters and helped George W. win the state by a razor-thin margin, and thus the presidency.\\n\\nPalast shows that the American political system is fundamentally broken, with corporations and their lobbyists dominating the political process, shaping legislation to benefit themselves rather than the people they claim to represent.\\n\\nPalast's investigations used to appear on BBC Newsnight and in The Guardian, but over time he has been frozen out of mainstream news. However, he still continues his investigations on his website and appears on YouTube-only news shows like Thom Hartmann, Ring of Fire, and The Real News.\\n\\nPalast's work during the late '90s and early 2000s period of American political and corporate corruption also served as the basis for his 2004 documentary film 'Bush Family Fortunes' which provides a deep insight into the political and corporate corruption that dominated the period.

A large, unwieldy Republican field that divides the anti-Trump vote. Opponents too afraid to attack him directly. Above all, a set of diehard fans who are providing him with a solid, unshakeable floor of support.\\n\\nAt the same time, it’s becoming clear Mr. Trump is bringing an entirely different level of political and professional experience to this primary process than in 2016.

In particular, he especially praised Taiwan's excellent internal communications and transparent election procedure while referring to the electoral process.🇹🇼👍🏻\\n\\nThanks Mr. Adam Powell’s great talk and special thanks also go to Prof. Jesse Chien-Chih Lu for being the Emcee, Prof. Tsung-Jen Shih, Office of International Cooperation and University of South California for organizing the seminar❤️❤️\\n\\n#cybersecurity #democracy #uselection #seminar #nccu #masterprogram #communications #政大 #碩士 #傳播\",\n",

       " 'On this day in 1877, just two days before inauguration, the U.S. Congress declared Rutherford B. Hayes the winner of the 1876 U.S. presidential election even though Samuel J. Tilden had won the popular vote.\\n\\nIt was one of the most contentious presidential elections in American history. Its resolution involved negotiations between the Republicans and Democrats, resulting in the Compromise of 1877, and on March 2, 1877, the counting of electoral votes by the House and Senate occurred, confirming Hayes as President. \\n\\nThe results of the election remain among the most disputed ever. Although it is not disputed that Tilden outpolled Hayes in the popular vote, there were wide allegations of electoral fraud, election violence, and other disfranchisement of predominantly Republican Black voters. After a first count of votes, Tilden had won 184 electoral votes to Hayes\\'s 165, with 20 votes from four states unresolved. In Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina, both parties reported their candidate to have won the state. In Oregon, one elector was replaced after being declared illegal for having been an \"elected or appointed official.\" The question of who should have been awarded those electoral votes is the source of the continued controversy.\\n\\nAn informal, \"back-room\" deal was struck to resolve the votes: the Compromise of 1877. In the deal, the Democrats conceded the 20 contested electoral votes to Hayes, resulting in a 185-184 victory; in return, the Republicans agreed to withdraw federal troops from the South, marking the end of Reconstruction. \\n\\nTo date, it remains the election that yielded the highest voter turnout of the eligible voting-age population in American history, at 81.8%.\\n\\nhttps://mapsofantiquity.com/products/the-republican-candidates-for-president-and-vice-president-rutherford-b-hayes-and-william-a-wheeler-harpers-weekly-prn001?_pos=3&_sid=e7aa6fbf2&_ss=r\\n\\n#mapsofantiquity #rutherfordbhayes #presidentsoftheUSA #USPresidents  #uselection #Presidentialelection #onthisday #thisdayinhistory #onthisdayinhistory #thisdayinushistory #onthisdayinushistory',\n",

       " \"The U.S. presidential election has a significant impact on the stock market. The market tends to be more volatile in the run-up to the election and can be affected by the results. The reason for this is that investors are uncertain about how the policies of the new administration will affect the economy and the stock market.\\n\\nIn the days leading up to the election, the stock market can be affected by the polls and the potential outcome. If a particular candidate is leading in the polls, the stock market may react positively, as investors believe that the candidate's policies will be beneficial to the economy. Conversely, if a candidate is trailing in the polls, the stock market may react negatively, as investors are uncertain about the candidate's policies and the potential impact on the economy.\\n\\nAfter the election, the stock market may also be affected by the results. If the candidate that is favored by investors wins the election, the stock market may react positively. Conversely, if the candidate that is not favored by investors wins the election, the stock market may react negatively.\\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that the stock market is affected by many factors and not just the election results. The market may also be affected by the economic conditions, company earnings, and global events.\\n\\nIn conclusion, U.S. presidential elections can have a significant impact on the stock market, with market volatility increasing leading up to the event and reacting to the results.

Meta’s vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said, “The public should be able to hear what their politicians are saying — the good, the bad and the ugly — so that they can make informed choices at the ballot box.”\\n\\nClegg added that Meta would intervene when there’s a “clear risk to real-world harm.” Additionally, Clegg said if Trump’s posts violate guidelines, the posts would be removed and he would be suspended from the platform for one month to two years, depending on the severity of the violation. \\n\\nTrump’s reaction: “FACEBOOK, which has lost Billions of Dollars in value since “deplatforming” your favorite President, me, has just announced that they are reinstating my account. Such a thing should never again happen to a sitting President, or anybody else who is not deserving of retribution!”\\nCivil Rights Groups’ rection: NAACP President Derrick Johnson said, “It’s quite astonishing that one can spew hatred, fuel conspiracies, and incite a violent insurrection at our nation’s Capitol building, and Mark Zuckerberg still believes that is not enough to remove someone from his platforms.”\\n\\nTrump’s account was suspended from several social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and YouTube in the wake of the January 6 Capitol riots. Trump was accused of praising people engaged in violent acts at the Capitol. Twitter recently reinstated his account after Elon Musk took over the micro-blogging site. \\n\\n#donaldtrump #trump #capitolriots #attackoncapitol #meta #facebook #instagram #snapchat #twitter #elonmusk #misinformation #unitedstates #usa #uselection #president2024 #republicans #trumpsuspended #markzuckerberg #capitolbuilding',\n",

He has been serving as a professor at American University in Washington, D.C. since 1973. He is co-credited with the creation of \"the Keys to the White House model,\" which is used as an effective tool to predict the results of US Presidential elections.\\n\\nIn an insightful conversation with Geostrata’s Harsh Suri (@suri.18), Dr. Lichtman narrated the intriguing account of how he devised \"The Keys to the White House Model\" in collaboration with a Soviet seismologist, Vladimir Keilis-Borok.\\n\\nThe interview further focused on possible outcomes of the 2024 US Presidential elections. Dr. Lichtman remarked that while it\\'s too early to predict the results of the 2024 elections, based on the keys model, the Democrats’ best chance of winning the elections is if Biden runs again; this way, the Democrats can secure two keys: the incumbency key and the party battle key.\\n\\nDr. Lichtman explained how, despite low approval ratings, Biden has secured an impressive set of legislative accomplishments, including major bills, and how he plays a significant role in preventing the Russian takeover of Ukraine.\\n\\nThe conversation further focused on the implications of the growing Hispanic voter turnout, how this has fundamentally changed the American electorate, and how different parties are leveraging these votes. Dr. Lichtman further emphasised on how the economy is not the sole factor determining electoral outcomes and is rather only one significant factor among many others.\\n\\nFind the full video on the Geostrata\\'s youtube channel!\\n\\nGraphics by @graphicsofstrata \\n\\n#geostrata #geointerview #allanlichtman #russiaukraine #russiaukrainewar #us #biden #trump #americanuniversity #whitehouse #uselection',\n",

       " 'There are some victories that are fragile, bitter, that take a long time to achieve and deserve little fanfare, writes Le Monde correspondent Pietr Smolar. The Republicans gained control of the House of Representatives eight days after the midterm elections, passing the 218 mark. The American media confirmed this outcome on Wednesday, November 16, following a good performance by the Democrats and a very laborious recount in some places. There will be a few more days of patience required for the final distribution of seats to be confirmed.\\n\\nForget the much-talked-about red wave. While their party is in the throes of division, the Republicans will be forced to exercise strict group discipline to maximize their narrow margins. It appears that Donald Trump\\'s precipitous bid for the 2024 presidency, which he announced on November 15, highlights a clash between two tectonic plates: MAGA (Make America Great Again) and the traditional Republican apparatus. The Democrats who control the Senate are ready to curl up like hedgehogs in the face of future attacks from the House, while they await the positive effects of the reforms initiated over the past two years by the Biden administration in 2023.\\n\\nThe US president said in a statement released on Wednesday night that he was ready to work with elected officials who are focused on the daily lives of citizens and congratulated the Republican Party on its success. Furthermore, he also warned, \"Voters have clearly expressed their concerns, the need to lower prices, protect the right to choose [abortion] rights, and the preservation of our democracy.\"\\n\\n➡️ Read more about the future of the US Congress following the midterm elections by clicking on the link in our bio.\\n-\\n📸: J.

       " 'Cultural and political divisions seem deeper than ever in today’s world. Cancel culture, tribalism and ‘woke wars’ have become part of our everyday vocabulary. But are these divisions dangerous? Should we dull down the rhetoric and all will be well or is social media to blame?\\n\\n We have certainly lived through some polarising events in the last decade and some of the language in these debates is polarising. But what really divides societies isn’t purely rhetoric, argues Myriam Francois. Rather, it is the material inequalities that create measurable and devastating divisions within our societies. Tech platforms exploit these divisions, after all it’s not their role to facilitate democracy. \\n\\nBut arguably, divisions in themselves are crucial to facilitating progress, argues Ella Whelan. The trouble comes when divisions deteriorate into tribalism. We also face the challenge that the clear divide between left and right is increasingly confused and less substantial. Political content is now much more personal, to do with identity more than political aspirations. We need to try and move away from this while still championing free speech. \\n\\nOn the contrary, we are overstating the polarisation problem, argues Paul Dolan. While there has been a slight increase in the degree to which people dislike their political opponents, this rise has only occurred at the far ends of the polarisation spectrum. For most of us little has changed. Identifying with a tribe is part of a well-functioning societies, and looking for tribes is part of the human condition. \\n\\nTo view the full debate, tap the link in our bio. \\n\\n#Tribalism #Polarisation #PoliticalDdebates #UKPolitics #Politics #WokeWars #CancelCulture #FreeSpeech #ExtinctionRebellion #Brexit #ClimateCrisis #TrumpsElection #DonaldTrump #USPolitics #USElection #CultureWars #War #PoliticsMagazine #BigIdeas #UKMagazine #ArtAndIdeas #SocialMedia #PoliticsToday #ArtAndIdeas #Trump #Biden',\n",

Democrats’ Senate win came even as Republicans were hoping to sweep the midterms amid factors such as inflation, a seemingly unpopular president and historic trends being on their side. However, after losing the Senate and projections suggesting a slim victory for Republicans in the House, it seems like the much-anticipated ‘red wave’ turned out to be a ripple. Are the midterm results a mandate against Donald Trump? Did election denialism and scepticism cost the GOP this election?

       " 'At 8:35 PM EST, Global Pollster can project that democrat Katie Hobbs has defeated election denier Kari Lake in the hotly contested Arizona Gubernatorial race. I can make this projection based on the fact that Kari Lake is only netting about 6000 votes for every ballot dump on Maricopa County. With only two drops left in the county, if Lake continues or even slightly improves her trajectory, she would only net about 16000-18000 votes,falling short of the current 26000 deficit she faces against her Democratic Opponent. The overwhelming bulk of the remaining ballots outside of Maricopa are in Pima County in which favour democrats, giving Lake an even more uphill battle to overtake Hobbs, with Hobbs potentially netting even more votes for Lake on releases of remaining Pima ballots.\\n#uselection #usa #arizona #midterms2022 #democrats #republicans #maricopa #pima',\n",
